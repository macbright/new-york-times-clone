                        <p>
                            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth,
                             with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and 
                             equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have 
                            been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to 
                            begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space 
                            itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster 
                            than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to 
                            pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and 
                            irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
                            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of 
                            the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time</a> with telescopes at the South 
                            Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected 
                            ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="#">gravitational waves </a>— the signature of a universe being wrenched 
                            violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the 
                            long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could
                            ever be proved.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy
                            pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science
                            and speculation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of
                            billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are
                            unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy
                            eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>‘As Big as It Gets’</strong><br>
                            
                            In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the reach of
                            particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct
                            observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle
                            space-time.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is
                            huge, as big as it gets.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and
                            preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic
                            Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set
                            of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

                                        <strong>THE UNIVERSE </strong> is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can
                                        observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever 
                                        we look, the universe has an even temperature.

                                        <strong> NOT ENOUGH TIME </strong> The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast distance from one side of the
                                        universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even
                                        temperature.

                                        <strong>DISTANT COFFEE </strong> At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup, and

                                        But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain

                                        <strong>INFLATION</strong>  solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded
                                        faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of
                                        the universe.

                                        <strong>Astronomers</strong> have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background
                                        radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.

                                        <strong>EXPANSION</strong>  Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding faster than light and cooling to an even temperature as it 
                                        expands. That is something like inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the origin

                                Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite confirmation in his
                                lifetime. “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”

                                The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for
                                fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a
                                professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his
                                office last week.

                                “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as
                                carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.

                                Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation, known as
                                chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford

                                Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that we ordered
                                anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. “Having news like this
                                is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.

                                By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists
                                responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution. Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this 
                                stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing project called the South Pole
                                Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the
                                cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he expressed reservations about
                                inflation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting that the new results
                                exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European Space Agency’s Planck
                                satellite and other assumptions about the universe.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings this year. At least a
                                dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.

                                Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered
                                accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has
                                operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal
                                observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California
                                Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.

                                “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23
                                times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.

                                The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to detect the faint spiraling gravity patterns — the signature of a
                                universe being wrenched violently apart at its birth.  
                            </p>

                                In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a
                                slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing
                                space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the direction of polarization of the
                                microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The
                                group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.

                            <p>
                                “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer,
                                making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to the breakthrough.

                            <p>
                                The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house
                                35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear
                                forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply different manifestations of a single unified force that ruled
                                the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or
                                brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force after another splitting away.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That was where Dr. Guth came in.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is
                                disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. In that case, space itself would become
                                imbued with a mysterious latent energy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow
                                itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space was created, the harder it pushed
                                apart.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic
                                speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic
                                history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars billions of light-years
                                across. “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be
                                the ultimate free lunch.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that
                                inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable homey expansion, the rest of
                                the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about going any deeper into the past.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation erases everything that came
                                before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away, forever out of our view.

                                “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the team, “you
                                wind up at inflation.”
