                        <p>
                            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth,
                             with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and 
                             equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have 
                            been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to 
                            begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space 
                            itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster 
                            than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to 
                            pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and 
                            irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
                            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of 
                            the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time</a> with telescopes at the South 
                            Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected 
                            ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="#">gravitational waves </a>— the signature of a universe being wrenched 
                            violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the 
                            long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could
                            ever be proved.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy
                            pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science
                            and speculation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of
                            billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are
                            unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy
                            eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>‘As Big as It Gets’</strong><br>
                            
                            In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the reach of
                            particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct
                            observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle
                            space-time.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is
                            huge, as big as it gets.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and
                            preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic
                            Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set
                            of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

                                        <strong>THE UNIVERSE </strong> is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can
                                        observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever 
                                        we look, the universe has an even temperature.

                                        But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain 
                                        their even temperature.

                                        universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even
                                        temperature.

                                        <strong>INFLATION</strong>  solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded
                                        faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of
                                        the universe.

                                        from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled.

                                        <strong>Astronomers</strong> have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background
                                        radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.
